# My portfolio :)
This is the first version for my personal website (portfolio).

Here are a couple of projects using front-end and back-end technologies, such as
Javascript, React, Node and Typescript.

There are also some other small things, mainly front-end stuff, as, itâ€™s something that
I really like.

More projects will be added soon.

## Deployment

## Techs used
This project was builded using React and Tailwind.

## What i learned
In summary, this is the first time using tailwind and i really like it.
The most challenging was reusing the class to not repeating code and having a pattern
in the elements or component where exactly the same class were used. For solve this, i 
followed what docs say about it, try to make use of components where needed and where not,
use shortcuts for apply rapidly style to all similar elements.

Whait i take away:

- While all items for the DOM are loading completely, it will print on the users screen a blank page, which is a bit annoying. it is possible to do some things in the middle. In static html before the application and its components are rendered, you can add a pre-loader page to avoid displaying the white page. Then, a little logic is added to remove this spinner once the App is ready.

## Improvement 
There's some components to be re factorized, mostly in the classes syntax using tailwind,
because not much logic was needed for this application. In the App.js i will use customHooks to compact
the logic.
